## How to access
Your tailscale magicDNS address

example:
https://MACHINE.MagicDNS-example.ts.net:5015

I use "Capy Reader" on android. ~ IMO the best currently.

for desktop I like the FreshRSS web interface.

Install your extensions.. I'm currently using the following:
      - Colorful list
      - Sticky Feeds
      - Title-Wrap
      - YouTube Video Feed (adjust video size to 1280x720)

## ⚙️ Configure `compose.yml` for Tailscale certs

This service expects TLS certs to be mounted into the container. Use an **absolute path** on your host. Details and folder layout:  
[deb-omv-dots/docker/tailscale-certs](https://github.com/dillacorn/deb-omv-dots/tree/main/docker/tailscale-certs)
